**DelayBox** is a High Throughput Distributed Task Scheduler âš¡. It is an advanced system designed to manage and execute a vast number of tasks across a distributed network of servers. Built on top of the **Redis** database, it leverages Redis's high-speed in-memory data store ðŸ”¥ for quick access and efficient task management.

> ðŸš€ This scheduler ensures optimal performance and reliability by utilizing protobuf for efficient data serialization and gRPC for robust communication between services. It features intelligent load balancing, dynamic scaling, and fault tolerance to handle high volumes of concurrent tasks without bottlenecks.

âœ… DelayBox also includes a centralized task delay mechanism, allowing precise control over task execution timings, which is critical for workflows requiring synchronized or delayed task processing. Additionally, the system offers the flexibility to integrate with **Kafka**, enabling seamless event streaming and message queuing for enhanced data processing capabilities.

ðŸŽ¨ One of the standout features of this application is its easy horizontal scalability, allowing it to grow and adapt to increasing workloads effortlessly by adding more servers to the network. Equipped with sophisticated algorithms for task prioritization and resource allocation, this scheduler ensures that critical tasks are executed promptly.



# Use-Case

It is ideal for applications requiring massive parallel processing capabilities, such as data processing pipelines, large-scale simulations, and real-time analytics.

Set Task
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/task  \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{"taskType":"PUB_SUB","parameter":{"executionTimestamp":"1721672590913"},"pyload":"VGVzdCBKYXkK"}'
```

to Get list of pending tasks (First 100 tasks)
```shell
curl "http://localhost:8088/task"
```
